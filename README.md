## 📖 Overview

**HEXplore** is an offline-first Android application purpose-built for the **Himalaya Engineering Exhibition (HEX 2083)** at **Himalaya College of Engineering (HCOE), Lalitpur, Nepal**.

The app transforms a visitor's smartphone into an active spatial compass. Distributed **ESP32 BLE beacons** placed at each exhibition zone broadcast unique identifiers. The app continuously scans for these signals, determines the visitor's current location using **RSSI-based proximity estimation**, unlocks the nearest zone's content, and renders a cyberpunk-aesthetic **spatial radar** centered on the user.

Visitors can explore department showcases, engage with gamified challenges, collect XP points, and navigate between zones using the in-app visual pathway guide — all without any internet connection.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🛰️ **Spatial BLE Radar** | Concentric animated radar UI showing the detected zone at the center and adjacent zones as orbiting bubbles |
| 🔓 **Proximity Zone Unlocking** | Zones auto-unlock when the visitor is physically near the ESP32 beacon; a lock screen prevents remote viewing |
| 📡 **Robust BLE Scanning** | Periodic 90-second scanner restarts bypass Android's BLE scan throttling for continuous, indefinite operation |
| 🗺️ **Visual Pathway Guide** | Zone detail pages include a "Nearby Destinations & Pathways" section with real photographs of connecting routes |
| 🎮 **Gamified XP System** | Completing zone challenges earns XP; a ranking ladder promotes from *Exhibition Guest* to *Exhibition Grandmaster* |
| ✅ **Persistent Visit Tracking** | Zones marked as visited are stored in Room SQLite DB and persist across app restarts |
| 📴 **Offline-First Architecture** | All zone data (projects, games, navigation, photos) is bundled in the APK — no internet required |
| 🌑 **Cyberpunk Dark UI** | Deep navy background, electric cyan accents, glassmorphic cards, and smooth animations |

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

See [`TECH_STACK.md`](TECH_STACK.md) for the full deep-dive technical architecture documentation.

**Quick Summary:**
- **Android App**: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Room + Moshi
- **BLE Hardware**: ESP32 microcontrollers running custom Arduino firmware
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Repository + Foreground Service

## 🤖 GitHub CI

The repository includes [`.github/workflows/android-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/android-ci.yml), which builds the debug APK on every push and pull request using GitHub Actions.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before building, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Android Studio** (Hedgehog 2023.1.1 or later) — or just the Android SDK CLI tools
- **JDK 17** (`java -version` should show 17.x)
- **Android SDK** with API Level 24+ installed
- **ADB** (`adb --version`) — comes with Android SDK platform tools
- **Arduino IDE 2.x** (for flashing ESP32 beacons)
  - Install `esp32` board package via Boards Manager

If you are setting up on Windows, start with [scripts/windows/README.md](scripts/windows/README.md). That folder explains which script to run for setup, build, install, and device checks.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nischal-hcoe/hexplore.git
cd hexplore
```

### 2. Configure Environment

- **Windows:** follow [scripts/windows/README.md](scripts/windows/README.md)
- **macOS/Linux:** copy `.env.example` to `.env` if the file does not already exist

### 3. Connect Your Android Device

Enable **USB Debugging** on your phone:
> Settings → About Phone → tap **Build Number** 7 times → Developer Options → USB Debugging ✅

Connect via USB, then verify:

```bash
adb devices
```

### 4. Build & Install

- **Windows:** follow [scripts/windows/README.md](scripts/windows/README.md)
- **Other platforms:** run `./gradlew assembleDebug` or `./gradlew installDebug`

The generated APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

## 🔌 ESP32 Beacon Firmware

Each physical exhibition zone requires one ESP32 microcontroller running the beacon firmware.

### Flashing Steps

1. Open `esp32_beacon.ino` in **Arduino IDE**
2. Install the ESP32 board package if not already present:
   - Boards Manager → search **esp32** by Espressif → Install
3. Select your board: `Tools → Board → ESP32 Dev Module`
4. Set the beacon ID for the target zone:
   ```cpp
   // At the top of esp32_beacon.ino:
   #define BEACON_NAME "HEX_BEACON_03"  // Change to 01, 02, 03, or 04
   ```
   | Value | Zone |
   |---|---|
   | `HEX_BEACON_01` | Main Gate |
   | `HEX_BEACON_02` | Registration Desk |
   | `HEX_BEACON_03` | Basketball Court |
   | `HEX_BEACON_04` | Architect Zone |

5. Upload to the ESP32 board (`Ctrl+U`)
6. The ESP32 will begin broadcasting immediately at maximum TX power (+9 dBm) in **non-connectable scannable mode**, ensuring no interference from nearby Bluetooth devices attempting to connect.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Zone Data (`hex_data.json`)

All exhibition content is driven by `app/src/main/assets/hex_data.json`. Each beacon entry follows this schema:

```json
{
  "beacons": {
    "HEX_BEACON_03": {
      "location_name": "Basketball Court",
      "short_description": "...",
      "image_asset": "img_basketball_court",
      "major": 1,
      "minor": 3,
      "detailed_info": {
        "about": "Zone description text...",
        "showcases": [ { "title": "...", "desc": "...", "image_url": "...", "category": "..." } ],
        "games": [ { "title": "...", "desc": "...", "image_url": "..." } ],
        "about_navigation": [
          { "title": "Adjacent Side: ...", "desc": "...", "images": ["img_architect_zone"] }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** After modifying `hex_data.json`, increment the `version` number in `AppDatabase.kt` to trigger a database reload on next app launch.
